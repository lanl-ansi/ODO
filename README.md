*****************************
See [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) for instructions on running/compiling **ODO**

The **ODO** executable can be found under ODO/bin/
*****************************

# Input

**ODO** takes two different files as input: [NET.json](data_sets/Power/IEEE13.json) and [ODO_INPUT.xlsx](data_sets/Power/ODO_INPUT.xlsx), these can be found under [data_sets/Power](data_sets/Power).

The first file contains all the network properties including branch resistance/reactance, bus shunts, operating limits, and others.

The excel file allows the user to adjust investment options and setup configurations such as runtime limit, maximum number of iterations, and others.
